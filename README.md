# Bot Battlr App
Bot Battlr is a simple, fun, and interactive React App where users can browse different bots, add them to their army, remove them from their army, or completely delete them from the site. 

The App demonstrates key React concepts:
1. Components: Dividing the app into reusable and manageable parts.
2. Props: Passing data between components.
3. State Management: Managing application data dynamically.
4. Data Fetching: Retrieving and managing data from a backend server.
5. Events: Adding interactive functionality to the UI.

### Technologies and Tools
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the app.
- **Event Listeners**: Click Events:
    - Add a bot to the army (addToArmy function).
    - Remove a bot from the army (removeFromArmy function).
    - Delete a bot forever (dischargeBot function).

### Features
1. **View All Bots**: 
   - The ```BotCollection``` component renders a list of all bots fetched from the server. Each bot is displayed as a ```BotCard``` with relevant details like its name, catchphrase, class, health, damage, and armor.
   
2. **Add a Bot to the Army**: 
   - By clicking the "Add to Army" button on a bot in the ```BotCollection```, the bot is added to the ```YourBotArmy``` component. The same bot cannot be added to the army multiple times (duplicate prevention).
   
3. **Remove a Bot from the Army**: 
   - By clicking the "Remove from Army" button on a bot displayed in the ```YourBotArmy```, the bot is removed from the user's army. It remains in the ```BotCollection```.
   
4. **Delete a Bot Forever**: 
   - Clicking the red "x" button on a bot (available in both ```BotCollection``` and ```YourBotArmy```) will:
        - Delete the bot from the backend server (DELETE /bots/:id).
        - Remove the bot from both the ```BotCollection``` and ```YourBotArmy``` on the frontend.
